# Comparing-Adverse-Effects-of-Tramal-and-Lyrica-Drugs

## Project Background
A group of doctors from Germany is exploring the potential side effects of drugs used to treat neurological pain. In addition to common treatments like gabapentin and Lyrica, they have found Tramal to be an effective option. Since these medications have similar effects, the doctors are interested in comparing their adverse effects. This comparison would help them choose the drug with fewer side effects for each patient, leading to better treatment decisions.

Insights would be provided on the following key areas:

1. What are the 10 most common adverse effects of Tramal as reported in the FAERS database?
2. Compare tramal to another medication called lyrica that is also commonly used to treat neurological pain. Are the adverse effects similar?
3. Define what further investigations might be helpful in determining whether a certain drug might be more preferable over another drug.
